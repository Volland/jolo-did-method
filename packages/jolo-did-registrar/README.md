# @jolocom/jolo-did-registrar

This module encapsulates the logic required to anchor Jolocom Identities using an instance of the Jolocom [registry smart contract](../registry-contract) and an IPFS gateway.
Additional functionality for updating the DID Document with a public profile is also exposed.
